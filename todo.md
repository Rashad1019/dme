### Phase 1: Analyze current matching algorithm and identify areas for improvement
- [x] Review the current matching algorithm logic in `matching-algorithm.js`.
- [x] Identify why match percentages are consistently low.
- [ ] Research best practices for candidate matching algorithms.
- [ ] Document specific improvements needed.

### Phase 2: Implement refinements to the matching algorithm
- [x] Adjust the scoring methodology to provide more intuitive percentages.
- [x] Implement better text analysis and keyword matching.
- [x] Add baseline scoring to ensure minimum reasonable match percentages.
- [x] Test different weighting approaches.

### Phase 3: Test and validate the updated matching algorithm locally
- [x] Set up local testing environment.
- [x] Test with various input scenarios.
- [x] Validate that match percentages feel more meaningful.
- [x] Ensure top candidates still rank correctly.

### Phase 4: Deploy the updated website
- [x] Deploy the refined matching algorithm.

### Phase 5: Present refined website and explanation to user
- [x] Explain the improvements made to the matching algorithm.
- [x] Show examples of improved match percentages.
